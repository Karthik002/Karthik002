I'm **Karthik Prasad**, a 3rd year student in the management engineering program at the University in Waterloo. I'm very passionate about software development, specifically in the fields of AI/ML, and web development. By helping build a startup from scratch with experts in their field, I have learnt about how a product is created and behaves/changes over time through design principles, software decisions and implementations as well as various issues that may occur in startups. In the future, I am eager to work at other companies and learn more about the software engineering world.
